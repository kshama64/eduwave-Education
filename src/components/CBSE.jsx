      <h1 className='cbseh2'> Central Board Of Secondary Education </h1>
      <p className='cbsepara'>CBSE conducts its final board exam for both class 10th and 12th examinations. The Board prepares its students throughout<br></br>the year with different sets of examinations that are conducted by the respective schools which also include the 10th and 12th <br></br>pre-board examination or the model exams. The Private or Public schools that are affiliated with the CBSE board follow the NCERT<br></br> curriculum.
